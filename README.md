## Description
This is a node app that automatically generates a readme file based on user input. Use this app to generate your readme files more quickly and without needing to put much thought into the process. This readme was written using this app!
    

## Installation
To install, simply clone this repository. If any errors occur while the app is running, try installing Node.js from [the official website](https://nodejs.org). If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to me through the Questions section below.
    

## Usage
To run the app, open your favorite command line interface in the root of the directory. Start the app by entering the command 'node index'. Follow the prompts, and a new README will be generated in no time! You can access this readme file in the distribution folder (dist) of this directory. From there you can move the readme into any local repository you wish and push it to your remote repo.
